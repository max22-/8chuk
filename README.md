# 8chuk

A port of the 8pen android app to the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/).
I discovered 8pen with this article from Ploum : [Writing on a smartphone: review of 8pen and MessagEase](https://ploum.net/writing-on-a-smartphone-review-of-8pen-and-messagease/).
I was also inspired by this video : [8pen + Joysticks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g2_PZv7OM8)

This transforms your Nunchuk + Raspberry Pi Pico into a USB keyboard.
